		Humber College<br>
		Project Duration: September 2016 - April 2017 <br>
  </H3><br>
  <H2>	Project:<br>
		Industrial Revolution 4.0: Building IoT Projects
  </H2><br>
  <H5>	Project Summary:<br>
		Industry 4.0, Industrie 4.0 or the fourth industrial revolution, is the current trend of automation and data exchange in 
		manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things and cloud computing.
		Industry 4.0 creates what has been called a "smart factory". Within the modular structured smart factories, 
		cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions. 
		Over the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in real time, 
		and via the Internet of Services, both internal and cross-organizational services are offered and used by participants of the 
		value chain.<br>

  <p>Placard made for the project.

   <!--ul>
    <li>Mechanical assembly of hardware components are being done. The main hardware components have been acquired i.e. Raspberry Pi and 
		On board camera for Raspberry Pi. As per the project schedule gathering of hardware components are on time, except I am behind
		the schedule for the PCB soldering.

	<li>The camera has been installed on Raspberry Pi.</li>
	<li>Acquired PCB kit. Will be work on soldering the PCB.</li>
	<li>The budget is found to be less than it was mentioned on the Project Budget. In the Budget it was mention around $200CAD
		but the final cost was around $170CAD. At this moment we do not need additional components for the project, but if anything is required
		it will be updated and notified.</li>
	<li>The current problem that is arising is on how to link the hardware to the cloud services. We are still working on it to figure it out</li>
