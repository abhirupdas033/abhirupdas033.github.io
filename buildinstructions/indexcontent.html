  <H3>	Introduction to Industrial Revolution 4.0:</H3><br>
		<p>
		The Industrial Revolution 4.0 project build instructions are created for any interested individual or group to reproduce our project by
		throughly following the steps detailed in this instruction page.<br><br>
		The Primary objective of our project is to periodically monitor machine setups in a 'smart factory' where all machines withing the 
		factory are connected to the internet and are constantly sending ans receiving information to a central hub. These information and operation
		of the machines are monitored and controlled by authorized personnel remotely, therefore a constant presence within the factory is no longer required. 
		This technological revolution where smart devices are interconnected over the network that interact with each other and operate defines the term
		Internet of Things (IoT)<br>

  <p>PowerPoint Presentation:

 <SECTION ID="Section_12">
  <H3>Week 12</H3>
  <p>Progress Report:
   <ul>
    <li>Latest progress on my project is to find a way to blink the LED on the PCB while the camera on the Raspberry Pi scans a QR code.
		Also a way to find out how to read voltage from the YL-40 AD/DA sensor on the PCB.</li>
	<li>I was successful in blinking the LED on the PCB. I wrote the code in Python which makes the LED to blink green one time when
		a QR code is scanned by the Pi camera module. This will eliminate the requirement for the user to check whether the camera has 
		scanned QR code or not on the Pi terminal. The code will be later added to my repository.</li>
	<li>The next target is to figure out a way to detect voltage on the 'AD2' PIN on the YL-40 sensor mounted on the PCB. As of now the 
		safe range to measure the voltage is between 0V - 3.3V DC. Anything beyond 3.3V will likely to damage the Raspberry Pi.</li>
	<li>The presentation of my project is on 6th Dec 2016 where I will be demonstrating my project that has been completed till now. For the presentation 
		I will be making a case for the Raspberry Pi with a stand that will hold a QR code printed on a piece of paper. For this I will be using
		acrylic to make the case and will be using laser cutter to cut and shape my design that I will draw using CorelDraw software.</li>
	<li>As for the budget there was no addition of any hardware that was required. Therefore our budget is still intact under $200. But a proper
		description of all the components will be listed below and their prices:<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Raspberry Pi Canakit from amazon.ca - $99CAD</li>
				<li>Raspberry Pi camera module V2 - $40CAD</li>
				<li>PCB sensor hat - $40CAD</li>
				<li>Acrylic case - $10</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	<li>As of now I am running along with the schedule.</li>
   </ul>
  </p>
 
 <SECTION ID="Section_11">
  <H3>Week 11</H3>
  <p>Progress Report:
   <ul>
    <li>Latest progress on my project was to demonstrate our project at the Open house on Saturday. By the end of the Open house I was 
		able to successfully demonstrate my project.</li>
	<li>I was facing OS corruption problem which stalled my project demonstration. But I was able to recover the OS and get back on track
		quickly and able to demo.</li>
	<li>The primary demonstration of my project was to show that the raspberry pi was able to detect a QR code using the Pi camera and display
		the data on the Pi terminal. I was successful in doing that.</li>
	<li>I was running a Python script that was detecting the QR code and displaying the output on the terminal screen.</li>
	<li>Now my next step is to make the LED on the sensor hat to work alongside with QR code scanner. For that I will be writing a code on C or python
		(which ever works best) that will detect the scan and on a successful scan it will make the LED blink on the sensor hat to green, otherwise
		it will blink red for an error occurred to detect the QR code.</li>
	<li>I will be finishing up this next milestone before I demo my final project for this semester on 6th December 2016.</li>
	<li>As for the budget there was no addition of any hardware that was required. Therefore our budget is still intact under $200.</li>
	<li>As of now I am running along with the schedule.</li>
   </ul>

 <SECTION ID="Section_10">
  <H3>Week 10</H3>
  <p>Progress Report:
   <ul>
    <li>Latest progress on my project was to install the Raspberry Pi camera module to the Raspberry Pi board and make the camera take
		images and record videos.</li>
	<li>Camera was installed and was able to take images and record videos.</li>
	<li>Next step was to get the Pi camera to scan the barcodes and save the data in a database located on a cloud network. Also the 
		cloud network is need to be setup properly so that it is able to save data in the database.</li>
	<li>Last week I ran into a problem. The OS of my Raspberry Pi got corrupted due to unformatted SD card that had a pre-installed OS 
		'Raspian-Jessie' and I had to format the whole SD card and flash the latest version of the 'Raspian-Jessie'.</li>
	<li>Now I have tested my PCB again on the new OS, ran all the scripts for the LED as well as the light and temperature sensor. PCB
		works as it supposed to be.</li>
	<li>My next step it to reconfigure the camera and make it to scan barcodes. I will be demonstrating it in the Open House on Saturday 
		12-NOV-2016 at 10AM</li>
	<li>As for the budget there was no addition of any hardware that was required. Therefore our budget is still intact under $200.</li>
	<li>As of now I am running a little behind the schedule. But I will be catching up to my schedule before demonstrating my project 
		in Open House on Saturday.</li>
